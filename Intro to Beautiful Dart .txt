Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Google in 2011.
It is an object-oriented language with C-style syntax that is designed to be easy to learn and use.
Dart was initially created to replace JavaScript as the primary language for web development, but it has since evolved to support a wide range of use cases, including server-side programming, mobile app development, and desktop app development.


Some key features of Dart include:

Strong typing: Dart is a statically typed language, which means that variables must be declared with their data types. This helps catch errors at compile-time, rather than at runtime.

Garbage collection: Dart features automatic memory management, which means that developers don't have to worry about manually freeing up memory when it's no longer needed.

Asynchronous programming: Dart has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which allows developers to write code that can handle multiple tasks at once without blocking.

Just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation: Dart supports both JIT and AOT compilation, which allows developers to choose between faster development cycles (JIT) or faster performance (AOT).

Flutter: Dart is the language used to develop Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building mobile, web, and desktop apps.

Overall, Dart is a versatile language that is well-suited for a wide range of applications. Its combination of strong typing, garbage collection, and support for asynchronous programming makes it a popular choice for web and mobile app development, while its support for AOT compilation makes it a viable option for server-side programming as well.
